0 // A Technic Flex-System is often seen curved in a model.  In 
0 // those cases, some part of the ends are normally fixed inside another 
0 // element, while the rest is bent.  The part "342.DAT" is 
0 // meant to model the straight parts of the ends.  To achieve this, 
0 // place one at each end point.  They should not be scaled.  The 
0 // part "343.DAT" is meant to model the rest.  If it 
0 // is curved, you would typically scale the "343.DAT" to a 
0 // have a short length, eg. 4LDU, and use many of them along the path of 
0 // the curve.  
0 // In the example below, the end points are 20LDU length, while 
0 // the centre part of the hose is scaled to have 56LDU length, thus 
0 // filling out the rest of the segment.
