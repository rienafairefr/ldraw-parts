0 A Technic Flex-System Hose is typically seen curved in a model.  In 
0 those cases, some part of the ends are normally fixed inside another 
0 element, while the rest of the hose is bent.  The parts "76.DAT" are 
0 meant to model the straight parts of the hose ends.  To achieve this, 
0 scale them to have the correct length (ie. 20LDU if they are fixed 
0 inside a unit length connector) and place them at the end points.  The 
0 parts "77.DAT" are meant to model the rest of the hose.  If the rest 
0 of the hose is curved, you would typically scale the "77.DAT" to a 
0 have a short length, eg. 4LDU, and use many of them along the path of 
0 the curved hose.  
0 In the example below, the end points are scaled to 20LDU length, while 
0 the centre part of the hose is scaled to have 80LDU length, thus 
0 filling out the rest of the hose.
