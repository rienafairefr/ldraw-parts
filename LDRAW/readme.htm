<FONT SIZE="+2">Welcome to LDraw!<BR>
This short readme file explains what files and subdirectories are
present in your LDraw installation, and has links to some sites on the internet
where you can find help and further information.<BR>

<A NAME="content">
<FONT SIZE="+1">What is contained in the LDraw directory:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Program executables:</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI>   <B>LDraw.exe</B><BR>
  This is the command line run program used to render *.DAT files.<BR>
  This program <B><I>must</I></B> be run with command line arguments to work, such as:<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>ldraw.exe car.dat</I></B><BR>
  If the program is run with no command line arguments specified, it will do nothing.<BR>
  More details on the command line arguments for LDraw.exe can be found in <A HREF="#ldraw">LDraw.htm</A>.<BR>
  Or you can use a "shell" program to run it, such as <A HREF="#info">LDraw Add-On or LDraw Launcher</A>.<BR>
  (This is highly recommended - much easier than typing in command line arguments)
<LI>   <B>LEdit.exe</B><BR>
  This is the interactive modelling program used to create models. This program is a
  simple graphic modelling program using keyboard inputs to place pieces in your model.
  More details on using LEdit can be found in the <A HREF="#ledit">LEdit.htm</A> file, and
  in the <A HREF="#tutorials">tutorials</A> available for it.<BR>
  This program seems difficult at first glance, but is really much easier to use than it first appears.
  And a lot of help is available from experienced users on the <A HREF="#lugnet">LUGNET newsgroups</A>.
<LI>   <B>MKList.exe</B><BR>
  This is a utility that creates a list of available
  parts. This list (parts.lst) is used by LEdit and
  by several other third-party utilities.<BR>
  Three things to remember:
  <UL>
   <LI>Run MKList now, immediately after installing LDraw.
   <LI>Run MKList after any parts update(s) are installed.
   <LI>You can Run MKList at any time to choose the sort order of your parts - Numerical or Description.
  </UL>
<LI>   <B>Rtm.exe</B><BR>
  A subroutine program used by LDraw.exe and LEdit.exe.
<LI>   <B>SL2LD.exe</B><BR>
  Conversion program. Used to convert SimLego files
  to LDraw files.<BR><B>The SL2LD program is no longer supported.</B>
</UL>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Support Files:</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI>   <B>Parts.lst</B><BR>
  This is your listing of all usable parts available.
  This list is created by running MKList.exe and choosing
  to create the list sorted Numerically or by Description.
  Most people use Description sorting, but you can
  change to whichever way you prefer at any time.
<LI>   <B>SL2LD.lst</B><BR>
  The parts list file used by the SL2LD conversion program.<BR>
  <B>The SL2LD listing is no longer updated or supported</B>.
<LI>   <B>Cga.bgi</B><BR>
  Graphics interface file used by LDraw and LEdit.
<LI>   <B>Egavga.bgi</B><BR>
  Graphics interface file used by LDraw and LEdit.
<LI>   <B>Vesa16.bgi</B><BR>
  Graphics interface file used by LDraw and LEdit.
<LI>   <B>Dpmi16bi.ovl</B><BR>
  Program overlay file used by LDraw and LEdit.
<LI>   <B>Update.scr</B><BR>
  Screen driver file used by LDraw and LEdit.
<LI>   <B>LDraw.pif</B><BR>
  Basic Win9x Program Information File.
<LI>   <B>LEdit.pif</B><BR>
  Basic Win9x Program Information File.
<LI>   <B>MKList-c.zip</B><BR>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Subdirectories:</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI>  <B>\BITMAP\</B><BR>
  This directory is where LDraw.exe saves .bmp-type
  graphics screenshots of model files. This can be done by
  using a combination of the -MS switch on the LDraw.exe
  command line AND having '0 STEP' lines located in the .dat
  file to be rendered.<BR>
  Note: the file <I>delete.me</I> in this directory can be safely deleted.
<LI>   <B>\MODELS\</B><BR>
  This directory is where your model .dat files are stored.
  There are two sample model .dat files installed for you
  to look at - <I>Car.dat</I> and <I>Pyramid.dat</I>.
<LI>   <B>\P\</B><BR>
  This directory is where part file primitives are located.
  Do not delete or alter these files.
<LI>   <B>\PARTS\</B><BR>
  This directory holds all the actual parts that can be used
  in creating or rendering your models.  A list of these
  parts can be seen by viewing the parts.lst file.
<LI>   <B>\HTMIMAGE\</B><BR>
  This directory contains image files for the HTML help pages.

<A NAME="update">
<FONT SIZE="+1">Parts Updates:</FONT>

 <UL>
<LI>The basic archive of <B>ldraw027.exe</B> contains the original parts
   and programs for LDraw that were released by James Jessiman.<BR>
   Since the untimely passing of James, many parts have been created
   and officially added.

<LI>If you have not already done so, you should visit <A HREF="http://www.ldraw.org/">www.ldraw.org</A> and
   download and install the full update package of new parts contained
   in the <B>complete.exe</B> file.

<LI>Periodically, new parts and part fixes are released in small updates,
   available from <A HREF="http://www.ldraw.org/">www.ldraw.org.</A><BR>
   These updates should be downloaded and installed as they become available.<BR>
   Please remember that OLD updates should not be installed over NEW or NEWER updates.<BR>
   Doing so might overwrite a fixed version of a part with an older version.

<LI>If you ever feel that you are missing parts, or something in your LDraw
  installation has been corrupted for any reason, the best recourse is to
  re-install the original archive - <B>ldraw027.exe</B> - followed by a new
  download of the <B>complete.exe</B> file from <A HREF="http://www.ldraw.org/">www.ldraw.org.</A>
  This will ensure that you have all the parts, with the latest fixes.
