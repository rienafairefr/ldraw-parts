Voting Problem:
It's now the night *after* the 2000-01 update was released.  For various 
reasons (such as: I'm a newbie parts-administrator), a few files were not 
included in the voting, but were released in the update.  I've decided to 
leave them in the update, rather than yanking them out.  I apologize for this 
mix-up, and I hope it doesn't cause anyone confusion.

Summary of changes to existing parts:

_Fixes to existing parts:

  4-4con1.dat (4/4 Cone 1:2 radii) 
     This primitive was renamed from 4-4con12.dat.  All files which 
     referenced 4-4con12.dat were updated.  The parts effected are:

     104.dat       Antenna 6H
     755.dat       Hose Flexible Segment End Section (open file for usage guide)
     751.dat       Hose Flexible Tube 7L
     6246d.dat     Minifig Tool Box Wrench
     6246b.dat     Minifig Tool Hammer
     6246e.dat     Minifig Tool Open End Wrench
     6246c.dat     Minifig Tool Power Drill
     6246a.dat     Minifig Tool Screwdriver

  Conditional edges in cross-axle primitives.
     All axle*.dat primitives which model the X-surfaces of the crossaxle
     were updated by adding conditional edge-lines.  The effected files
     are:

     axle.dat      Axle
     axlehol4.dat  Axle Hole #4
     axlehol5.dat  Axle Hole #5
     axlehole.dat  Axle Hole

  6246c.dat     Minifig Tool Power Drill
     This part was repositioned to put the handle on the Y-axis.  This 
     allows the part to be easily inserted into a minifig hand.

  10p03.dat     Baseplate 24 x 32 with Set 358 Dots Pattern
     The pattern was corrected

  3461.dat      Propeller  4 Blade  5 Diameter with Rotor Holder
     This part was accidently dropped during a previous update, when 
     it should have been renumbered.  3461 is the correct number.

  71184.dat     Bar  4.5L Straight
     This part was slightly shorter than it should have been.

  3861.dat      Door  1 x  4 x   5 with 4 Panes
  73312.dat     Door  1 x  4 x   5 with 6 Panes
     The descriptions on these two parts were switched.

  Various fixes and improvements were applied to:
