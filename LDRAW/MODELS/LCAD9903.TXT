Fixes as of May 17, 1999 and released
as an entire update, lcad9903:

(see also file part9903.txt for a description
list of pieces contained in this update)

-Annoying change ALERT.   **** READ THIS ****
 In order to correct both incorrect numbers and to conform
 to the numbering scheme, the following files were changed.
 The problem is that no corresponding "~Moved to" files 
 could be created to make the change painless.  So, ANY MODEL
 YOU HAVE THAT USES NUMBERS FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF THIS LIST
 MUST BE CHANGED BY HAND.  Failure to do so will cause the model
 to have the wrong piece in it:

OLD NUMBER                NEW NUMBER
   3137    was changed to   3137c01   with NO ~moved to file.
   3149    was changed to   3149c01   with NO ~moved to file.
   3324    was changed to   3324c01   with NO ~moved to file.
   3939    was changed to   3942      with NO ~moved to file.
   3942    was changed to   3943      with NO ~moved to file.

      What these pieces were:
         3137 WAS Brick  2 x  2 with Wheels
         3149 WAS Hinge Plate  2 x  5
         3324 WAS Hinge Plate  2 x  9
         3939 WAS Cone  2 x  2 x  2
         3942 WAS Cone  4 x  4 x  2

 Note that the last two 3939/3942 directly conflict with each other.
 My sincerest apologies for this. But in order to fix things,
 we have to bite the bullet sometime.

-Major revisions to minifig torsos.  All torsos were

  were modified. This is to simplify and improve future 
  torso patterns.

  9326 is *not* the correct number for an armless torso.
  ~Moved to files for all affected pieces ARE included.
