General Fixes
1. Minifig Torsos.  The 'neck mark' tag was removed from the 'plain' 
   minifig torso subfile, 973S01.DAT.  This required modification to all 
   existing torso part files, but allowed us to correct the neckmark from 
   using color 24 (which L3P and L3Lab report as an error) to a more-correct
   color, specific to each torso pattern.  This is especially important for 
   the plain torso, since it should have no neck mark.

2. Town parts renamed.  All the parts in the 'town category' were renamed, 
   most of them to the Minifig Accessory category.  Not all these parts
   are included in this update; some files had other changes and were not
   certified in time for the release.

   changed to    Minifig Cup

   changed to    Minifig Seat  2 x  2

   4095.DAT      Town Umbrella Stand Small
   changed to    Bar  6.6L with Stop

3. Propellors and Rotors renamed.  To provide better naming and grouping,
   various propellor parts were renamed, moving all to the propellor 
   category.  Not all these parts are included in this update; some were 
   not certified in time for the release.

   4745.DAT      Propellor  2 Blade
   changed to    Propellor  2 Blade  5.5 Diameter

   2479.DAT      Rotor  4 Blade
   changed to    Propellor  4 Blade  5 Diameter

4. Bad byte removed from files.  A number of basic part files had a non-
   printing byte, ctl-X, at the end of the file.  This byte was removed 
   from the following files:
