Voting Results - L-Cad dat vote 9902
10 vote-sheets tallied - some were partial/incomplete 

-READ THIS!!!!!!
 Included in this update is the new makelist program, MKLIST.exe.
 This program appears to work on all DOS/Win9x/WinNT platforms.
 Please use this program instead of makelst2 or makelst3.
 If you have any problems, please let us know!
 Also included is the source code in the file mklist-C.zip.
 Users of LDAO can still use that programs internal makelist
 utility as well. 

-Below is the raw data for the vote.  Be advised that not all
 pieces listed below are included in this update!
 1.  Some pieces did not pass. 
 2.  Some pieces that nominally "passed" generated quite a
     few questions as to their accuracy. Upon close examination, 
     I concurred that those parts did indeed have serious problems.
     As a result of those questions, and my examination, those pieces
     have been removed.  Furthur info below.
 3.  There is an ongoing effort to widen the scope of represented parts
     within LDraw.  Some of the pieces in the current voting need to be 
     held briefly in order to minimize the need for later renamings
     and/or renumberings. The held pieces are noted below.
     Better to have some released now, right?

-Pieces marked with an * by the number had some sort of 
 modification to name and/or description. Details below.
 All parts starting with an X that did not get new
 correct numbers had the X dropped.

        great.  :-)

  No new primitives added.

_Some patterned pieces had their numbers "corrected" prior to voting.

 original xxxxPnn.dat format:

 Some duplicates still exist. Use the new MKLIST.exe with the -c switch
 to see a listing of remaining duplicates.  Suggestions to fix them welcome.

_In addition, these three pieces were similarly modified
 to conform with the the changes above:
  3612.DAT      Arm Piece Straight with 2 and 3 Fingers
  412.DAT       Arm Piece Turned with 2 and 3 Fingers 
  30000         Brick  2 x  2 with Pins and Axlehole

I _think_ this is a complete list of what has been done. :-/
