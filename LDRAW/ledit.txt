LEdit beta 0.4 documentation.

The LEdit program is to create and edit your models.
This program is interactive and uses keyboard commands.
Sorry, no mouse support.

Piece Movement
   Move the Current piece in 6 axis on the screen:

     Arrow Keys
       Move the piece onscreen in the direction indicated by the arrow.
       Except in the default Three-D view where the movement is toward
       the corners of the screen:
           Up Arrow moves the piece toward the upper-right corner.
           Down Arrow moves the piece toward the lower-left corner.
           Left Arrow moves the piece toward the upper-left corner.
           Right Arrow moves the piece toward the lower-right corner.

     Home
       Home generally moves the piece directly Away from you, but this is usually
       not apparent due to LEdit not having any perspective. An exception is when
       using the default Three-D view, where it moves the piece Up in a true
       vertical motion.

     End
       End generally moves the piece directly Toward you, but this is usually not
       apparent due to LEdit not having any perspective. An exception is when
       using the default Three-D view, where it moves the piece Down in a true
       vertical motion.



Page up
  Selects the Previous piece to make it the Current piece.
  Scrolls up through the list of pieces in your model.



Page down
  Selects the Next piece to make it the Current piece.
  Scrolls down through the list of pieces in your model.



A
  Turns the Current piece 90 degrees clockwise (looking from above the
  piece).



C
  Gets prompt to change Current piece Colour.
  Then enter a colour number:

    0 = Black 
    1 = Blue 
    2 = Green 
    3 = Dark Cyan 
    4 = Red 
    5 = Magenta 
    6 = Brown 
    7 = Grey 
    8 = Dark Grey 
    9 = Light Blue 
   10 = Light Green 
   11 = Cyan 
   12 = Light Red 
   13 = Pink 
   14 = Yellow 
   15 = White 
   16 = Null-colour
        Pieces using null colour code use whatever colour code is entered
        on the command line when rendering with LDraw or, if no colour code
        is specified, they default to a #7 Grey colour.
   Clear Colours.
        Add 32 to get clear versions of the colours.
        For example, to get clear red use 36 (32 for clear + 4 for red)
   Note: After setting a pieces colour, each subsequent piece added to the
         model will be that same colour, until the colour is changed.



E
  Erases the screen. Will cause the program to redraw the model.



I
  Insert new piece.
    Inserts a new line for a piece directly below the current one.
    The current line and above are moved up to make room.
    The new piece inserted is the same as the previously used piece,
    but does not have the previous pieces orientation.



M
  Move setting adjustment.
    This adjusts the distance a piece moves when using the Arrow, Home or End keys.
    The current setting is shown at the top of screen.
    Three settings are available:
       Fine
         The Fine setting moves a piece 1/20 of a stud sideways or
         1/8 of a plate thickness up.

       Normal
         The Default setting.
         The Normal setting moves a piece 1/2 of a stud sideways or
         1 plate thickness up.

       Coarse
         The Coarse setting moves a piece 5 studs sideways or
         10 plate thicknesses up.



P
  Gets prompt to enter a Piece number.
  Changes the Current piece to the one specified.
    3001.dat = 2x4 Brick
    3002.dat = 2x3 Brick
    3003.dat = 2x2 Brick
        When entering part numbers, only the number need be
        entered - the .dat is not required
  Or press Enter at the Part no: prompt for a scrollable list of pieces.
  Placing the scroll highlight on the desired piece and pressing Enter
  will select that piece.



W
  Swap the Current and the Next pieces.



X
  Gets prompt to move the Current piece in the X direction.
  Enter the number of LDraw units you wish to move the piece.



Y
  Gets prompt to move the Current piece in the Y direction.
  Enter the number of LDraw units you wish to move the piece.



Z
  Gets prompt to move the Current piece in the Z direction.
  Enter the number of LDraw units you wish to move the piece.

 

-
  Zooms out. Will cause a redraw of the entire screen.
  The current setting of the zoom factor is shown at the top
  of the screen.



+
  Zooms in. Will cause a redraw of the entire screen.
  The current setting of the zoom factor is shown at the top
  of the screen.



LEdit Menus
  Use the '/' or 'ESC' keys to activate the menus.
  Then use the arrow keys to navigate the menu.
  Or use the key shortcuts shown.

File Menu    [key shortcut = /F]

     Load    [key shortcut = /FL]
             Loads an existing model file.
                WARNING: Current file will not be saved first!
                         Save prior to loading!

     Save    [key shortcut = /FS]
             Saves the file. Press enter to use the name suggested.
             Or type a new name.
                WARNING: Save often! LEdit can crash under some circumstances,
                         so make it a habit to save after placing a few pieces.
     Exit    [key shortcut = /FE]
             Exits the program.  Prompts to save the current file if needed.



Edit Menu    [key shortcut = /E]

     Insert    [key shortcut = /EI]
               Inserts a new piece. Same as 'I' above.

     Delete    [key shortcut = /ED]
               Deletes the Current piece.
     
     Swap      [key shortcut = /ES]
               Swaps the Current a Next pieces. Same as 'W' above.

     Line-Type [key shortcut = /EL]
               Changes the current line type to:

                  Piece    [key shortcut = /ELP]
                           Set Line-Type to Piece. The default setting.

                  Comment  [key shortcut = /ELC]
                           Set Line-Type to Comment. This line contains a text
                           comment which you may type in.
                           Note that there are three special comment types:
                              PAUSE
                                 Typing PAUSE (must be in capital letters) in
                                 the comment field causes LDraw to pause when
                                 rendering the model file.  Similar to the 
                                 STEP command below, but without the graphic
                                 output capabilities.
                              WRITE
                                 Typing WRITE (must be in capital letters)
                                 in the comment field causes LDraw to show
                                 whatever text is after the WRITE command
                                 onscreen in the upper-left corner. This has
                                 limited functionality due to LDraw not
                                 clearing the text before writing other text,
                                 resulting in a confusing mixture of text.
                              CLEAR
                                 Typing CLEAR (must be in capital letters)
                                 in the comment field causes LDraw to erase
                                 all pieces displayed up to that point.
                                 LDraw then continues by displaying all pieces
                                 after the CLEAR command.

                  Step     [key shortcut = /ELS]
                           Set Line-Type to Step. This line separates the steps
                           in a model. Steps normally cause LDraw to pause when
                           rendering and, when the LDraw command line switch -MS
                           is specified, cause LDraw to output a bitmap picture
                           of the model.
                           Note that the STEP command is all capitals - useful
                           to remember if adding STEP's to a model file in a
                           text editor.


View Menu    [key shortcut = /V]
   Change the current view to the one selected. Will cause a redraw of the screen.
   For reference, in the default Three-D mode, 'Front' is considered to be a view
   from the lower-left corner of the screen.  So a model of a car would point
   toward the lower-left corner of the screen.  See the car.dat model file
   included with this program for an example of proper orientation.

     Front      [key shortcut = /VF]
                Change to a Front view of the model.

     Right      [key shortcut = /VR]
                Change to a Right side view of the model.

     Left       [key shortcut = /VL]
                Change to a Left side view of the model.

     Back       [key shortcut = /VB]
                Change to a Back (rear) view of the model.

     Over       [key shortcut = /VO]
                Change to a Over (above) view of the model.

     Under      [key shortcut = /VU]
                Change to a Under (beneath) view of the model.

     Three-D    [key shortcut = /VT]
                Change to a Three-D view of the model. This is the default view.

     Out(Zoom)  [key shortcut = none]
                Same as '-' above.

     In(Zoom)   [key shortcut = /VI]
                Same as '+' above.

     Centre-Set [key shortcut = /VC]
                Sets the centre of the viewing window to be wherever the blinking
                cursor is located. Not to be confused with the Centre-Set used for
                turning pieces. (see below)



Turn Menu        [key shortcut = /T]
                 WARNING: When turning a piece, be careful to only use NUMBERS
                 where prompted. Using letters will cause LEdit to crash, losing
                 all work done to a model since the last save.

     X-axis      [key shortcut = /TX]
                 Gets Prompt to turn the Current piece around the X-axis. Enter
                 the number of degrees to turn the piece from 0 to 360.
                 May also use negative numbers to turn in the opposite direction.

     Y-axis      [key shortcut = /TY]
                 Gets Prompt to turn the Current piece around the Y-axis. Enter
                 the number of degrees to turn the piece from 0 to 360.
                 May also use negative numbers to turn in the opposite direction.

     Z-axis      [key shortcut = /TZ] 
                 Gets Prompt to turn the Current piece around the Z-axis. Enter
                 the number of degrees to turn the piece from 0 to 360.
                 May also use negative numbers to turn in the opposite direction.

     Centre-Set  [key shortcut = /TC]
                 Sets the centre of rotation to be wherever the cursor is
                 currently located.

                    1. In most cases, you will probably want to place the
                       Centre-Set on whatever piece you are about to turn. If you
                       place Centre-Set on the piece you want to rotate, the piece
                       will rotate around its own default center. (which is good)

                    2. If you do not place the Centre-Set on the piece you want to
                       rotate, but place it or leave it on some other piece, the
                       piece you are trying to turn may rotate around a wide arc
                       centered on wherever the Centre-Set happens to be.
                       This will most likely cause your piece to rotate right out
                       of the viewing window. (which can be very annoying)

                    3. But there are some cases where, with a little planning,
                       placing the Centre-Set somewhere other than on the piece
                       you are about to turn can be advantageous. Doing this
                       successfully takes some practice and patience.



Piece Menu    [key shortcut = /P]

     File       [key shortcut = /PF]
                Gets prompt to change the Current piece number. Same as 'P' above.
                Or press enter for a scrollable list of pieces.

     Colour     [key shortcut = /PC]
                Gets prompt to change the Current piece colour. Same as 'C' above.

     Goto-Line  [key shortcut = /PG]
                Gets prompt to move to a different line number in the model.
                Enter the line number where you wish to go, or enter a very large
                number to jump to the end of the file.  Useful in a large model
                where scrolling using the Page Up/Page Down keys is too slow.



Options Menu    [key shortcut = /O]

     Line-as-Stud    [key shortcut = /OL]
                     Causes LEdit to display studs on pieces as either simple
                     lines or as full studs. The default setting is (on) which
                     shows the studs as simple lines.  This improves the drawing
                     speed and makes alignment of parts easier. Each selection of
                     this option switches the setting.

     Start-at-Line   [key shortcut = /OS]
                     Selecting this causes LEdit to start drawing from the Current
                     piece when the screen is redrawn.  The current line where
                     drawing starts from is shown in parenthesis. The default is
                     line (0) - the first piece. The program resets to (0) when 
                     started. This option is useful by allowing earlier pieces to
                     not be drawn, thus speeding up redraws of the screen and
                     reducing onscreen clutter.

     Stop-at-Cursor  [key shortcut = none]
                     By default, LEdit draws all pieces up to and including the
                     Current piece.  All pieces after the Current piece are not
                     drawn.  Selecting this option causes LEdit to draw all
                     pieces in a file regardless of which piece is currently
                     selected. Each selection of this option switches the setting.



Quit Menu    [key shortcut = /Q]
             Exits the program. If there have been no modifications to the model
             file, the program exits immediately.  If the model file has been
             modified, you are asked if you want to save before exiting:

                Yes     [key shortcut = /QY]
                        Gets a prompt to Save the file. Press enter to use
                        the name suggested. Or type a new name.

                No      [key shortcut = /QN]
                        Exits the program without saving.

                Cancel  [key shortcut = /QC]
                        Returns to the program.



Typical LEdit Screen (see diagram below)
  The LEdit screen consists of four text lines, a separator bar, and a
  viewing window. The first text line is a informational status line.
  The following three lines show the Previous, Current, and Next pieces
  in the model file. 
  
  What each pointer means in the diagram below:

     Current line
         This shows what line in your model your are working on.

     Orientation of viewing window
         Shows what view the window is currently displaying.
         Use key shortcut /V to change.
     
     Zoom factor
         Shows the current magnification level of the screen. Use the +
         or - keys to change.

     Move increment
         Shows the current Movement setting. Use M to cycle through
         Normal/Coarse/Fine settings.

     Piece filename
         Shows the actual filename for the Previous/Current/Next pieces.

     Previous piece
         The top line of the three parts lines is the Previous piece.
         Use the Page Up key to scroll it into the Current piece position
         to edit.

     Next piece
         The bottom line of the three parts lines is the Next piece.
         Use the Page Down key to scroll it into the Current piece position
         to edit.

     Current piece
         The center line of the three parts lines is the Current Piece.
         The piece in this position is the one on which all editing is done.

     Piece orientation
         This series of nine numbers describe a pieces orientation - what angle
         of rotation it has - among its three axis, X,Y, and Z.
         These numbers will change when the piece is turned using the key
         shortcuts /TX, /TY and /TZ

     Piece Z coordinate
         This number shows a pieces Z coordinate - where it is located - in
         three dimensional space.  Depending on the current view, use the proper
         Arrow, Home, or End keys to change. 

     Piece Y coordinate
         This number shows a pieces Y coordinate - where it is located - in
         three dimensional space. Depending on the current view, use the proper
         Arrow, Home, or End keys to change.

     Piece X coordinate
         This number shows a pieces X coordinate - where it is located - in
         three dimensional space. Depending on the current view, use the proper
         Arrow, Home, or End keys to change. 

     Colour
         This number shows a pieces colour code. 
         Use C or the /PC key shortcut to change.

     Line-Type
         This number will always be a 1 for pieces. For Comments added with
         the /ELC key shortcut, or STEPS added with the /ELS key shortcut,
         it will be a 0.

    Viewing Window
         This is where the visual display of the model is shown. This is also
         where the visual display of parts files available for use is shown
         when the P then Enter key is pressed.
